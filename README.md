# GraphTheory Year 3 Project 2017

## Project Overview
This Repo is for a Project for my 3rd year Module Graph theory. The aim of this project is to take information from our timetable system 
and represent this information on a informative and easy to read graph. This graph would then be used for presentation using it to explain how the timetable works
and why graphing it out and detailing it visually is a great way to go about solving this problem.
This project was done using <a href="https://neo4j.com/" style=""> Neo4J </a>
### What is <a href="https://neo4j.com/" style=""> Neo4J </a> ?
<a href="https://neo4j.com/" style=""> Neo4J </a> is a highly scalable native graph database that leverages data relationships as first-class entities, helping enterprises build intelligent applications to meet todayâ€™s evolving data challenges. It is perfect for taking vast amounts of information and representing them in sleak perfect graphs.
The graphing of this information is done using:
* Nodes 
* Relationships
* Labels
* Rel types
* Properties

### Queries
To create and use these components in Neo4J you use cypher queries.
#### Examples of Queries used
##### For a lecturer node
CREATE (n:Lecturer {Name: 'Ian Mcloughlin' }) RETURN n 
##### For a Module node
CREATE (n:Modules {Module: 'Graph Theory' }) RETURN n
##### For a Room node
CREATE (n:Rooms {room: 'PF15' }) RETURN n
##### For creating relationships
MATCH (a:Lecturer {Name: 'Ian Mcloughlin' }), (b:Modules {Module: 'Graph Theory'}) 
MERGE (a)-[:`Lectures`]->(b)

## Dev Experience 
Before this module I had never heard of Neo4J so like most of this course has been it was a learning experience. Making graphs and navigating the different parts of this whole thing was interesting.
