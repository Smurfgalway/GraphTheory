# GraphTheory Year 3 Project 2017

## Project Overview
This Repo is for a Project for my 3rd year Module Graph theory. The aim of this project is to take information from our timetable system 
and represent this information on a informative and easy to read graph. This graph would then be used for presentation using it to explain how the timetable works
and why graphing it out and detailing it visually is a great way to go about solving this problem.
